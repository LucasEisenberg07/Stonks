# Stonks

Stonks is a website that can get data from a stock and querry a chatbot on if you should buy, sell, or hold. 

This is obviously a joke, do not take investment advice from an AI.

## To run this project:

1. Run ```npm install```
2. To start the project ```node index.mjs```
3. Go to http://localhost:1000/ to see the website in action
4. Have fun!
